1.A: Get the MNIST digit data set

1.B: Build a network model
* TODO: plot the architecture (1-B)

1.C: Train the model
Based on the plot, training accuracy has exponentially increased as well as the test accuracy. It seems like there is no overfitting.
We could say it as an example of benign overfitting as model we built generalizes well to the test set.

1.E: Read the network and run it on the test set
Our model has learned the pattern of the handwritten numbers quite well. For the 9th image, it seems like it can be both 
interpreted as 5 or 6, and our model has classified it as 5 instead of 6.
